Image is composed of individual pixels, and the essence of image processing is to process these pixels. The correlation between pixels is important information, and it cannot be completely separated, which is also the starting point of many image algorithms. Convolution is a common operation in mathematics. In image processing, it changes the details of the image by performing operations between the image and the convolution kernel. Convolution or filtering operations on images are widely used in various scenarios, such as various filters and convolutional neural networks. This article will explore the knowledge of linear algebra applied in image processing convolution through image filtering.

&lt;p>Image processing refers to the analysis, processing, and processing of images to meet visual, psychological, or other requirements. Image processing is an application of signal processing in the field of images. Currently, most images are stored in digital form, so in many cases, image processing refers to digital image processing. In addition, processing methods based on optical theory still occupy an important position.&lt;/p></description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://nand.fun/posts/linear-algebra-in-imaging/feature.webp"/></item></channel></rss>
