## Feature

- **Owl** uses **Pro Micro** Interconnect small controller board, which means easy for Maintenance and replacemen. And supports a variety of boards including [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano) and [nrfmicro](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/) (I **have not tried yet**, but theoretically feasible).
- Low latency wireless, supported by [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk).
- Gorgeous **RGB** lighting effects.
- **Two** multifunctional **OLED** screens that can display keyboard battery level and connection status.
- Split keyboard conforms to **ergonomics**.
- A total of **two** PCBs compatible with Cherry MX switches, Kailh choc Low Profile switches, and Gateron Low Profile switches.
- **Double-sided** PCB design, both sides are universal.
