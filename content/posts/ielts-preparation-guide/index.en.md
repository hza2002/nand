## Section-Specific Strategies  

### Listening  

- **Patterns**: Each part follows fixed formats (**academic/conversational, monologue/dialogue**).  
- **Vocabulary**: Focus on spelling, synonyms, and context comprehension. Expect unfamiliar words—learn to move past them.  
- Note word limits for answers. Predict answer types (numbers/nouns/verbs/plurals) from questions.
- **Highlight keywords** to track your progress. If lost, use keywords to relocate.
- Use gaps to pre-scan later sections. Prioritize **Part 3 keywords** before Part 1 starts.
- **Part 1**: Drill common formats (postcodes, phone numbers, dates, currencies).

### Reading  

- **Core principle**: Match questions to the text.  
- **Vocabulary**: Master high-frequency words (CET-4/6, IELTS core lists). Skip obscure terms—they’re rarely tested.  
- **Speed**: Time yourself (10+15+25 minutes). Never linger on a question—all are worth 1 point.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Skim headings, questions, and paragraph openings/closings first.  
  - **Parallel Reading**: Tackle multiple question types in one pass if they follow text order.  
  - Combine **skimming** (find sections) and **scanning** (extract answers).  

### Writing  

- **Time**: 15m for Task 1, 40m+5m planning for Task 2.  
- The question types and structures of the essays are formulaic; the structure can be roughly adjusted as needed. Remember **transition words** and **formulaic sentences**, and practice your thought process
- Task1 tests **descriptive ability**, with the structure: *Paraphrase* + *Overview* + *Detail1* + *Detail2*. Memorize the common words for each question type and practice how to identify key points
- Task2 tests **persuasive ability**, with the structure: *Introduction* + *Body1* + *Body2* + *Conclusion*. Learn the methods of **presenting viewpoints** + **discussion** + **examples** for argumentation

### Speaking  

- **Goal**: Think and speak naturally. Avoid over-rehearsed answers.  
- **Practice**:  
  - Record yourself. Use fillers (*well*, *you know*) to buy time.  
  - Prioritize **fluency** over complex vocabulary.  
- **Part 1**: Prepare short answers about daily life.  
- **Part 2**: Reuse adaptable stories (people/events/objects).  
- **Part 3**: Expand answers with brainstorming—examiners assess depth and coherence.

- [Shen Xiaoyi Series Books](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%85%8E%E5%B0%8F%E5%B6%B7/3190397): Highly recommended books like "Breaking IELTS Writing in 10 Days" and "Breaking IELTS Speaking in 10 Days." Buy physical copies for in-depth study.

## Final Tips  

- **Band scores Corresponding to Number of Mistakes**: The IELTS official website and various educational websites have this information. Why are you focusing on this? Are you trying to control your score!? Just aim to do your best.
- **Booking the Exam**: Make sure to read all the announcements on the IELTS official website and book your exam date as early as possible. Set a **deadline** for yourself to avoid procrastination.
- **Computer-based/Paper-based**: If you are proficient enough with a standard keyboard, I recommend the computer-based test. You can use software to simulate and compare; there are many advantages, especially for writing where you can freely format and not worry about handwriting (I repeatedly adjusted paragraphs and sentence orders during the exam, and even wrote scattered sentences before combining them).
- **Tutoring Classes**: If you have sufficient self-motivation and information-searching skills, you can definitely skip these classes. Moreover, the cost of tutoring is often equivalent to several actual exams.
- **Exam Day**: Try to schedule the exam in the morning and the speaking test as early as possible in the afternoon. Cramming English at the last minute is not helpful; it's better to take advantage of your morning energy to push through, avoiding excessive stress.
- **Past Papers**: I haven't used them much, as I feel the Cambridge IELTS materials provide enough practice. However, for speaking, considering the changing question seasons, it might be useful to look at recent exam materials for their timeliness.

## Long-Term Learning  

If you are pursuing the long-term cultivation of English ability or want to understand the essence and methods of language learning, [罗肖尼Shawney](https://space.bilibili.com/323794482)'s explanation (Comprehensible Input Hypothesis) is the answer:
- [How to Truly Master a Word](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ns4y1A7fj)  
- [Rethinking Language Learning: Listening/Speaking](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1tf4y1s7NN)  
- [Rethinking Language Learning: Reading](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1aD4y127GE)  

Overall, fluency in a foreign language stems from **massive** exposure to **comprehensible** listening and reading materials. It involves finding a series of materials that are moderately challenging (**i+1**, meaning slightly above your current level), interesting, and sufficient in quantity. Only through extensive input, akin to acquiring a sense of language as one does with their native tongue, can one naturally begin to speak and output the language.
